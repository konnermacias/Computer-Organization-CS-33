Problem: 3.68

3.68) What are the values of A and B?

First note alignment rules for different data types:
char -> 1
short -> 2
int -> 4
long -> 8

Note the following:
 - Since we know that str2.t of type int starts at 8, the B in char array[B] is bounded between values of 5 and 8.
 - Also we know that str2.u of type long starts at 32, the A in short s[A] is bounded between values 7 and 10. Since s is a short data type array, each one of its members takes up 2 bytes. So really we have 2*A is bounded between values of 14 and 20.
- Lastly, we know str1.y of type long starts at 184, so the values A*B is bounded between values of 45 and 46. Since x is a 2D array of ints, each one of its members takes up 4 bytes. So really we have 4*A*B is bounded between values of 180 and 184.

Now we can solve!
We have:
45 <= A*B <= 46
5 <= B <= 8
7 <= A <= 10

Solving for the system of equations, we find that A = 9 and B = 5.
