Homework 3
Problem: 3.70

3.70) A. What are the offsets in bytes of the following fields:

e1.p = 0 bytes offset
e1.y = 8 bytes offset // within the struct, it's after a long data type which is 8 bytes long
e2.x = 0 bytes offset // the two structs start at the same offset since it's a union
e2.next = 8 bytes offset // pointers are 8 bytes offset

B. How many total bytes does the structure require?

The structure requires 16 bytes

C. Fill in the missing expressions in the code for proc.

void proc (union ele *up){
	up->e2.next->e1.y = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e2.x;
}
